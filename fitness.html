          <p class="lorem">Most people would suggest that during your period, it’s better to do the exercises you can tolerate, that are good for your body, and that you like to do. For many people, the first day or two of their period may be not the best time to exercise. This is typically due to a heavier flow. During this time, you may feel more comfortable exercising at home. If the first few days of your periods are difficult, take it easy and make modifications to your workouts as needed.</p>

          <h3>Dancing</h3>
          <p>This is a great exercise during periods. Accompanied by music, this fun exercise not just helps you burn
            calories but also reduces stress and fatigue. It also helps fight stiffness that many women experience
            during their period.</p>

          <h3>Swimming</h3>
          <p>While the thought of dipping your body in water during your period may not sound like a great idea, but
            trust us, swimming is one of the gentlest exercises to do. It is relaxing and helps you ease out of your PMS
            symptoms, whether physiological or physical.</p>

          <h3>Sumo squats</h3>
          <p>While the mention of sumo squats may sound counterintuitive during your period, it is a great form of
            exercise.
            When done correctly without overexerting yourself, this exercise strengthens your hips, calves, and inner
            thighs. This also helps in preventing pain and heaviness in the legs, which is one of the most common period
            issues.</p>

          <h3>Stretching</h3>
          <p>Stretching is one of the best forms of a workout during periods that is great for relaxing your muscles and
            easing cramps and pain. This also makes your body more flexible by decreasing stiffness and soreness in your
            back and legs. You can opt for exercises such as torso stretch, standing triceps stretch, and hamstring
            stretch.

            and abdominal discomfort. It needs no special equipment and can be done anywhere. You can take as much time
            as you need and adjust your speed to match your comfort levels.</p>
