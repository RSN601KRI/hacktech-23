          <p class="lorem">Most people would suggest that during your period, it’s better to do the exercises you can tolerate, that are good for your body, and that you like to do. For many people, the first day or two of their period may be not the best time to exercise. This is typically due to a heavier flow. During this time, you may feel more comfortable exercising at home. If the first few days of your periods are difficult, take it easy and make modifications to your workouts as needed.</p>

      <h1>Sumo squats</h1> <hr><br>
      <p>While the mention of sumo squats may sound counterintuitive during your period, it is a great form of
        exercise.
        When done correctly without overexerting yourself, this exercise strengthens your hips, calves, and inner
        thighs. This also helps in preventing pain and heaviness in the legs, which is one of the most common period
        issues.</p>
